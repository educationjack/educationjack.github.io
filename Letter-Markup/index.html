  <h1><abbr title="Regarding">Re:</abbr> Eileen Dover university application</h1>

  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty
    to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.
    I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
  </p>

  <!-- H2 #1 -->
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time; however it would suit us better
    if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
    <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
    <li>Third semester:  <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please let me know which start date you would prefer.</p>
  <p>
    You can find more information about important university dates on
    <a href="http://example.com" title="Important university dates">our website</a>.
  </p>

  <!-- H2 #2 -->
  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a <em>pretty open-minded</em> research facility—as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. Of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following (in priority order):
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30
        <abbr title="degrees Celsius">&deg;C</abbr> (86 <abbr title="degrees Fahrenheit">&deg;F</abbr>), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
    <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Please provide more information on each topic, including expected duration, required staff/resources,
    and anything else we should know. Thanks.
  </p>

  <!-- H2 #3 -->
  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I studied exotic tribal dances. My <strong>favourite</strong> dances are below, with definitions:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>
      A little-known but influential dance dating back as far as 300
      <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>: a whole village would dance in a circle like chickens to
      encourage their livestock to be “fruitful”.
    </dd>

    <dt>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
      Before Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they practiced this dance—huddling close together
      on the floor and shuffling in imperceptibly tiny, rapid movements. One of my fellow students said he thought
      this inspired modern styles such as twerking.
    </dd>

    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>
      An instance of historic misinformation—English explorers in the 1960s believed they had discovered a new dance
      characterized by “robotic” movements among Northern Alaskans and Canadians; later it was discovered they were simply very cold.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
